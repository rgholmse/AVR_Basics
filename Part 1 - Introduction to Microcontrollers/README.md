# Introduction to Microcontrollers
### Goals
 - Understand what a microcontroller is
 - Know where microcontrollers are used
 - Know why microcontrollers are used
 - Know what an AVR is, and why it is used in this course
 - Understand project design flows
 - Blink a LED

### Solution
By cloning the github repository or by manually downloading/copying the contents of main.c the solution can be explored. To program the AVR connect the AVR128DA48 Curiosity Nano kit to your computer and use Microchip Studio or MPLAB X to upload the code. 
#### Microchip Studio
